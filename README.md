## Introduction to Bionic Reading Script
Bionic Reading is an emerging reading method aimed at improving reading speed and comprehension. Its core advantage lies in bolding the key letters of words, guiding the brain to automatically complete word recognition and processing. This visual cue reduces eye strain and enhances information retrieval speed, especially benefiting those who are easily distracted or fatigued while reading.

## Advantages of Bionic Reading:
- **Increased Reading Speed:** Reduces the time the eyes spend on each word, enhancing fluency.
- **Improved Focus:** The bold letters guide the reader, minimizing brain pauses and maintaining reading rhythm.
- **Enhanced Comprehension:** Reduces unnecessary eye movement, helping to quickly grasp key points.

## Script Features:
- Automatically identifies and bolds key parts of words.
- Supports toggling the function using hotkeys: `Alt + B` for Windows and `Control + B` for Mac, applicable to all English website content.
- Dynamically adjusts the bolding strategy based on word length and dictionary definitions, adapting to different reading scenarios and needs.
